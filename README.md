# Shopping-Cart-CLI
I have created a shopping cart application by implementing the concepts of Object Oriented Programming. My main aim was to develop a good grip on implementing object oriented programming.
<br>
In this application, user can create account or login and then he can do shopping. 
<br>His history and other account details will be saved in the txt file so it would be easy for him to come again and do shopping from this application.
