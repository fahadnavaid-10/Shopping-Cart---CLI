I have created a shopping cart application by implementing the concepts of Object Oriented Programming. My main aim was to develop a good grip on implementing object oriented programming.

In this application, user can create account or login and then he can do shopping. His history and other account details will be saved in the txt file so it would be easy for him to come again and do shopping from this application.
